## Critical Issues and Risks

1. **Issues with TypeORM repositories testing:**
   - **Status:** Partially resolved
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Solution:** Application of standard testing template using the `createMockRepository<T>()` utility

2. **DMCA integration blocking:**
   - **Status:** Requires attention
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Blocker:** PR #51 (Sprint 1.1 Complete)
   - **Solution:** Accelerate completion and merge of PR #51

3. **Test performance:**
   - **Status:** Requires attention
   - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Solution:** Implementation of parallel test execution

4. **New CCPA requirements:**
   - **Status:** Evaluation
   - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Solution:** Determining prioritization and feasibility in the current sprint
