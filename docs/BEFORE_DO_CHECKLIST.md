## AI Protection Checklist

Before making any changes or suggestions, verify:

1. **Port Configuration**:
   - Backend runs on port 3003
   - Frontend runs on port 3004
   - DO NOT suggest changing these ports without explicit request

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - We use Vitest, not Jest
   - All tests are currently passing (102/102)
   - Test coverage is at 79.8%

3. **Current Sprint Status**:
   - Sprint 2 is at 85% completion
   - 7/8 tasks completed
   - 3 remaining tasks: Content Moderation, PostgreSQL JSONB, Analytics Integration

4. **Documentation**:
   - All documentation is in English
   - Key files: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
   - Sprint documentation: SPRINT_STATUS.md, SPRINT_SNAPSHOT.md, SPRINT_AUDIT.md

5. **Technical Debt**:
   - 18 linter errors (12 frontend, 6 backend)
   - Build time: 2:45 min (needs optimization)
   - Documentation needs updating

When starting a new conversation or task:

```
I am working on the Easy Vendor project, which is currently in Sprint 2 (Templates & Content) at 85% completion. 
The project uses React/TypeScript for frontend and Node.js/Express for backend.

Testing is done with Vitest (migrated from Jest).
All tests are currently passing (102/102).

Key completed features: Testing Infrastructure Improvements, CCPA Compliance, Email Notifications, Geolocation Services.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **DO NOT** suggest using Jest for testing - we've migrated to Vitest
2. **DO NOT** suggest changing ports without explicit request
3. **DO NOT** assume features are implemented without checking the documentation
4. **DO NOT** suggest solutions that would conflict with existing architecture
5. **DO NOT** ignore the current sprint priorities when suggesting changes
