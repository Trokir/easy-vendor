## Problem Analysis and Bottlenecks

### Code Hotspots

1. **LegalConsentService**: 
   - Repository test issues, TypeORM mocks need improvement
   - Error handling needs enhancement

2. **DmcaReportController**: 
   - Syntax errors in tests
   - Lack of proper service mocks

3. **EmailService**:
   - Fixed configuration issues in tests
   - Refactoring needed to improve testability

### Blockers

1. **TypeORM mocking issues**: 
   - Need to create a standard template for mocking TypeORM repositories
   - Created a tool in `src/utils/typeorm-test-utils.ts` to unify the approach

2. **Bot protection integration**:
   - Waiting for reCAPTCHA service API keys
   - Temporary solution: using stubs in the test environment

## Achievements and Progress

- ✅ Successfully fixed tests for RegisterForm
- ✅ Created a template for mocking TypeORM repositories
- ✅ Set up documentation for common issues in TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- ✅ Developed templates for service and controller testing

## Next Steps

1. Resolve LegalConsentService test issues using the new mocking approach
2. Fix syntax errors in controller tests
3. Unify the approach to testing services that use TypeORM
4. Supplement documentation with examples of using testing templates
