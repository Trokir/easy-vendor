# Task: Fix Testing Infrastructure Issues in Easy Vendor Project

## Overview
A comprehensive fix for the testing infrastructure in the Easy Vendor project is required. The existing issues prevent proper test execution and accurate code coverage measurement, which is critical for ensuring product quality.

## Priority
**High** - The lack of a reliable testing infrastructure blocks the deployment of new features and creates regression risks.

## Current Status
- Frontend/backend test separation with respective configurations added
- UI component testing utilities created
- Context and service mocks implemented
- Basic structure for Playwright E2E testing prepared

## Issues to Resolve

### 1. ESM Module Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Errors like `Cannot use import statement outside a module` when working with axios and @sendgrid/mail
- Unable to run tests that interact with these libraries

**Potential Solutions:**
- Update Jest to version 28+ with native ESM support
- Configure babel.config.js for proper module transformation
- Replace problematic libraries with CommonJS alternatives

### 2. TypeORM and Decorator Issues
**Symptoms:**
- `ColumnTypeUndefinedError` errors when testing services
- Problems with using `reflect-metadata` and decorators

**Potential Solutions:**
- Enable `emitDecoratorMetadata` and `experimentalDecorators` options in tsconfig.json
- Add explicit `reflect-metadata` import in all test setup files
- Create complete mocks for TypeORM repositories and entities

### 3. Material-UI Issues
**Symptoms:**
- `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'matches')` errors when using `useMediaQuery`
- Problems with Material-UI themes in tests

**Potential Solutions:**
- Enhance the `renderWithMui` function for proper media query support
- Mock `useMediaQuery` for all UI component tests
- Create a specialized setup file for Material-UI tests

### 4. Dependency Conflicts
**Symptoms:**
- Unable to install new dev dependencies (npm install @playwright/test)

**Potential Solutions:**
- Audit and update all dependencies in package.json
- Use `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve conflicts
- Switch to another package manager (yarn, pnpm)

## Expected Results
1. All tests can be run without infrastructure errors
2. Code coverage measurement works correctly
3. Environment is prepared for E2E testing implementation
4. CI/CD integration added for automatic test runs

## Acceptance Criteria
- At least 90% of tests run without infrastructure errors
- Code coverage reporting process is configured
- All testing settings and approaches are documented
- All test examples from TESTING_IMPROVEMENTS.md are implemented

## Technical Details
```bash
# Minimum library versions
Jest: ^28.0.0
TypeORM: ^0.3.0
React Testing Library: ^13.0.0
Playwright: ^1.32.0
```

## Effort Estimation
- **Root cause investigation**: 1 day
- **ESM issues fixing**: 2 days
- **TypeORM test configuration**: 2 days
- **UI component mock improvements**: 2 days
- **CI/CD test configuration**: 1 day
- **Documentation and solution testing**: 1 day

**Total**: 9 days (1.5 - 2 weeks accounting for potential blockers)

## Additional Context
See TESTING_IMPROVEMENTS.md file for a complete description of the current state of the testing infrastructure and improvements made.
